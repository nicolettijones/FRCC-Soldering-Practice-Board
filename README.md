## To Order this PCB:

Download the zip file below. You do not need to unzip this file to order the board. 

[Download FRCCWolfPCB.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolettijones/FRCC-Soldering-Practice-Board/main/Zipped%20Gerbers/FRCCWolfPCB.zip)

Using a PCB manufacturer (I used PCBWay to order the test boards for this project), start a new order and select the option to upload gerber files. 

Upload the FRCCWolfPCB.zip file. The pre-selected options should not need to be changed, except you will need to select HASL lead-free solder if you want the lead free option. You will also need to change the order quantity to the desired number. 

When selecting shipping, keep in mind that the actual shipping times (especially for USPS) may be longer than the estimates. The USPS option also does not provide detailed order tracking after the shipment has left China. Also factor in a day or two for the order design to be approved. 

The rest is pretty self-explanatory, but please feel free to reach out if you run into any issues.
